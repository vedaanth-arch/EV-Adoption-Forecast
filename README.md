EV Adoption Forecasting
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners need to anticipate infrastructure needsâ€”especially charging stations. Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, impacting user satisfaction and hindering sustainability goals.

Problem Statement: Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.

Goal: Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.

Dataset: This dataset shows the number of vehicles that were registered by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.

Date: Counts of registered vehicles are taken on this day (the end of this month). - 2017-01-31 2024-02-29
County: This is the geographic region of a state that a vehicle's owner is listed to reside within. Vehicles registered in Washington
State: This is the geographic region of the country associated with the record. These addresses may be located in other
Vehicle Primary Use: This describes the primary intended use of the vehicle.(Passenger-83%, Truck-17%)
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): The count of vehicles that are known to be propelled solely by an energy derived from an onboard electric battery.
Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): The count of vehicles that are known to be propelled from energy partially sourced from an onboard electric battery
Electric Vehicle (EV) Total: The sum of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
Non-Electric Vehicle Total: The count of vehicles that are not electric vehicles.
Total Vehicles: All powered vehicles registered in the county. This includes electric vehicles.
Percent Electric Vehicles: Comparison of electric vehicles versus their non-electric counterparts.
